## Getting Started

This repo contains my personal dotfiles, as well as scripts and ansible playbooks for bootstrapping and maintenance.

```
bash <(curl -s https://surrealtiggi.github.io/dotfiles/install.sh)
```

## Requirements

- `neofetch` for system info
- `neovim` as the default cmdline editor
- `htop` as the activity manager
- `iterm2` as the terminal util
- Terminal mods as follows:
  - `oh-my-zsh` as the shell
  - `powerlevel10k` as the theme
  - `nerd-fonts` for _ALL_ the glyphs
  - `nord` as the terminal color scheme
  - `RobotoMono` as the terminal font, but anyone patched by nerd-fonts will work
  - `colorls` to colorize and decorate `ls`

### Homebrew

List in `brew.txt` for now
