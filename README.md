# dotfiles

These are some of my personal dotfiles. I don't stick to any particular distro so some stuff doesn't necessarily work across various distros, so just cherry pick as needed.

## Requirements
- `neofetch`  for system info
- `vim` as the default cmdline editor, with a few plugins therein
- `htop` as the activity manager
- Terminal mods as follows:
  - `oh-my-zsh` as the shell
  - `powerlevel10k` as the theme
  - `nerd-fonts` for *ALL* the glyphs
  - `nord` as the terminal color scheme
  - `RobotoMono` as the terminal font, but anyone patched by nerd-fonts will work
  - `colorls` to colorize and decorate `ls`
