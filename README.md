These are some of my personal dotfiles.

## Requirements

- `neofetch`  for system info
- `neovim` as the default cmdline editor
- `htop` as the activity manager
- `iterm2` as the terminal util
- Terminal mods as follows:
  - `oh-my-zsh` as the shell
  - `powerlevel10k` as the theme
  - `nerd-fonts` for *ALL* the glyphs
  - `nord` as the terminal color scheme
  - `RobotoMono` as the terminal font, but anyone patched by nerd-fonts will work
  - `colorls` to colorize and decorate `ls`

### Homebrew

List in `brew.txt` for now
